*   Primary key column:
    *   Use the name `id` and then `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`.*   Foreign key columns:
    *   Add `_id` to the singular name of the column you are referencing.
    *   If the primary key is `SERIAL`, then the foreign key should be `INTEGER`.
    *   You also should create the foreign key with `REFERENCES table_name(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.*   Names, emails, usernames and passwords can all be stored as `VARCHAR(255)`. Students to cohorts would be `cohort_id`. The type would be `INTEGER` .*   Dates would use the `DATE` type. If we needed [date and time](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-datetime.html), use `TIMESTAMP`.*   Numbers:
    *   We will use `INTEGER` to represent most [numbers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-numeric.html). There are other _sizes_ of integers as well.
    *   **SMALLINT** -32,768 to 32,767 (thirty-two thousand)
    *   **INTEGER** -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (two billion)
    *   **BIGINT** -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (nine quintillion)
    *   **SERIAL** 1 to 2,147,483,647 (auto incrementing)*   Dates, Phone Numbers & Currency
    *   Become familiar with the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date formatting standard. The string `'2018-02-12'` uses this format to represent 'February 12th, 2018'. Year, month and then day. Dates should be stored consistently. Apply timezones and formatting when displayed to the user.
    *   Store phone numbers as `VARCHAR`, there are so many possible formats. The number `214 748 3647` hits our `INTEGER` limit.
    *   Store currency as an integer representing cents. Use a `BIGINT` if you need values over $21 million dollars.
